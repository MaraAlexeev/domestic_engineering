    "text": "I have two little boys and also live in the physical plane. Thus I have lots of domestic tasks in my life, and I have wondered if I am doing them in the smartest and easiest way I could be. So here I will layout my experiences as I learn how I can things better around the house. I feel like there is a lot of mythology around how do many household tasks—do I really need to separate colors from whites—and l want to devote a little time to figure things out now, and then not worry my head about it until the robots replace me. Also, I want to learn how to use this new, fun thing Quarto, so I’m blogging about with that!\nSome topics I’m going to research include the following:\n\nLaundry\nWashing dishes and am I using my dishwasher correctly!"
